long_name: Double-precision floating-point division
description: |
  `fdiv.d` performs the Double-precision floating-point division of `rs1` by `rs2`.
  This is analogous to its Single-precision counterpart but operate on 
  Double-precision operands and produce Double-precision results. 
  _fmt field is set to D (01) for this D extension.
  The 2-bit floating-point format field `fmt` is encoded as shown in Table.
  
  .Format field endcoding.
