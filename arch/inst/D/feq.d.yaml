long_name: Double-precision floating-point equal
description: |
  `feq.d` is defined analogously to their single-precision counterparts, 
  but operates on Double-precision and produce Double-precision.
  Writes 1 to _rd_ if _fs1_ and _fs2_ are equal, and 0 otherwise.
  If either operand is NaN, the result is 0 (not equal). If either operand is a signaling NaN, 
  the invalid flag is set.
  Positive zero is considered equal to negative zero.
