name: aes64im
long_name:  This instruction accelerates the inverse MixColumns step of the AES Block Cipher, and is used to
            aid creation of the decryption KeySchedule.
description: |
  The instruction applies the inverse MixColumns transformation to two columns of the state array,
  packed into a single 64-bit register. It is used to create the inverse cipher KeySchedule, according to
  the equivalent inverse cipher construction in (NIST, 2001) (Page 23, Section 5.3.5). This
  instruction must always be implemented such that its execution latency does not depend on the
  data being operated on.
