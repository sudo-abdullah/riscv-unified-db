kind: instruction
name: aes64ks1i
long_name:  This instruction implements part of the KeySchedule operation for the AES Block cipher involving
            the SBox operation
description: |
  This instruction implements the rotation, SubBytes and Round Constant addition steps of the AES
  block cipher Key Schedule. This instruction must always be implemented such that its execution
  latency does not depend on the data being operated on. Note that `rnum` must be in the range
  `0x0..0xA`. The values `0xB..0xF` are reserved.
