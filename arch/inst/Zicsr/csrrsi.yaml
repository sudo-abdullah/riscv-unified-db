long_name: Atomic Read and Set Bits in CSR with Immediate
description: |
  This variant is similar to `CSRRS`,except this updates the CSR using an XLEN-bit value
  obtained by zero-extending a 5-bit unsigned immediate (`uimm[4:0]`) field encoded in
  the `rs1` field instead of a value from an integer register. For `CSRRSI`, if the `uimm[4:0]` 
  field is zero, then these instructions will not write to the CSR, and shall not cause any of
  the side effects that might otherwise occur on a CSR write, nor raise illegal instruction 
  exceptions on accesses to read-only CSRs. This will always read the CSR
  and cause any read side effects regardless of `rd` and `rs1` fields.
