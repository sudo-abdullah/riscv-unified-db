name: csrrc
long_name: Atomic Read and Clear Bits in CSR
description: |
  The `CSRRC` instruction reads the value of the CSR, zero-extends the value to `XLEN` bits,
  and writes it to integer register `rd`. The initial value in integer register `rs1` is  
  treated as a bit mask that specifies bit positions to be cleared in the CSR. Any bit that is high in `rs1` will  
  cause the corresponding bit to be cleared in the CSR, if that CSR bit is writable.
