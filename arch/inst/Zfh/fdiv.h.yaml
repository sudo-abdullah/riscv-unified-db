name: fdiv.h
long_name: Half-precision floating-point division
description: |
  `fdiv.h` performs the half-precision floating-point division of `rs1` by `rs2`.
  This is analogous to its Single-precision counterpart but operate on 
  half-precision operands and produce half-precision results.
  _fmt field  It is set to H (10) for this instruction.
  The 2-bit floating-point format field `fmt` is encoded as shown in Table.
  
  .Format field endcoding.
