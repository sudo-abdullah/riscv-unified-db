name: fdiv.q
long_name: Quad-precision floating-point division
description: |
  `fdiv.h` performs the Quad-precision floating-point division of `rs1` by `rs2`.
  This is analogous to its Single-precision counterpart but operate on 
  quad-precision operands and produce quad-precision results.
  _fmt field  It is set to Q (11) for this instruction in the Q extension.
  The 2-bit floating-point format field `fmt` is encoded as shown in Table.
  
  .Format field endcoding.
